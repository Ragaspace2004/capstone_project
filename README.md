# Capstone Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning platform for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction using the AdventureWorks dataset.

## Project Structure

- Data: CSV files with customer, product, and sales data.
- ML Models: Random Forest and Neural Network models for CLV prediction.
- Web Apps: Streamlit applications for interactive CLV prediction.

## Key Files

- train_clv_model.py: Trains a Random Forest CLV model.
- train_ann_csv.py: Trains a Neural Network CLV model.
- clv_app.py: Streamlit app for Random Forest CLV predictions.
- ann_clv_app.py: Streamlit app for Neural Network CLV predictions.
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Train models:
   ```
   python train_clv_model.py
   python train_ann_csv.py
   ```
3. Launch the app:
   ```
   streamlit run clv_app.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   streamlit run ann_clv_app.py
   ```

## Data

Place the provided AdventureWorks CSV files in the project directory.
